# React Message Box

Well, it might not be so convincing to call this a message box. This is a real-time commenting demo to help me get familiar with React and Firebase. 

I found the tutorials on the Internet are quite vague, so I made this repo in case I get lost in the future. 

## Local Deployment

You have to create a Firebase App instance in order to deploy this application locally (with your own commenting system).

Then, a `.env` file is required under the root directory:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=xxx
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxx
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=xxx
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=xxx
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxx
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxx
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=xxx
REACT_APP_APP_ID=xxx
```

Install all the packages with `npm install`. You can run the app with `npm start` afterwards. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
